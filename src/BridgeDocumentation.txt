This document lays out the basics of the card game "bridge" in relation to this project.

Bridge is played with a standard 52 card deck. The cards are dealt to four players. When these players finish the hand,
rather than shuffling the deck, they set the four hands aside and move to a different table. Then, a new set of four
players comes and plays the hand. In this way, a single hand can be played by many people. Performance on that hand is
then ranked, and match points are assigned to the highest scoring partnerships.

The players of a hand are denoted by their compass directions, North, East, South, and West, where the pairs NS and EW
are partnerships.

Players bid for a contract, and these bids are recorded as Number, Suit. If the number is n, the pair has committed to
take at least n + 6 tricks. The suit bid determines the trump suit of the contract.

Most games of bridge have the hand records, contracts, and results all uploaded to a central server run by the
American Contract Bridge League. This server is not built as an easily analyzed database, so this program is focused on
reformatting the data on the website into a single database.
